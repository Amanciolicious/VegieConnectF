# Onboarding Fix - Show Only for Newly Registered Users

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Onboarding was showing for all users, including existing users who had already seen it.

**Solution**: Modified the system to track newly registered users and show onboarding only for them.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Enhanced User Registration**
- Added `isNewlyRegistered: true` field to new user accounts
- Added `onboardingCompleted: false` field to track onboarding status
- Users are marked as newly registered during signup

### 2. **Updated PIN Verification Flow**
- Checks if user is newly registered after PIN verification
- Shows onboarding only for newly registered users who haven't completed it
- Routes existing users directly to login page

### 3. **Enhanced Login Flow**
- Checks user's registration status from Firestore
- Shows onboarding only for newly registered users
- Existing users go directly to landing page

### 4. **Improved Onboarding Page**
- Accepts `userId` parameter to track completion
- Updates both SharedPreferences and Firestore
- Marks users as no longer newly registered after completion

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **New User Registration Flow:**
```
1. User signs up → isNewlyRegistered: true, onboardingCompleted: false
2. User verifies PIN → Check if newly registered
3. If newly registered → Show onboarding
4. User completes onboarding → onboardingCompleted: true, isNewlyRegistered: false
5. User goes to landing page
```

### **Existing User Login Flow:**
```
1. User logs in → Check user data from Firestore
2. If isNewlyRegistered: false → Go directly to landing page
3. If isNewlyRegistered: true but onboardingCompleted: true → Go to landing page
4. If isNewlyRegistered: true and onboardingCompleted: false → Show onboarding
```

## 📊 **Database Schema Updates**

### **Users Collection:**
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "role": "buyer|supplier|admin",
  "verified": boolean,
  "isNewlyRegistered": boolean, // NEW: Track newly registered users
  "onboardingCompleted": boolean, // NEW: Track onboarding completion
  "createdAt": timestamp,
  "pin": "string",
  "pinExpiresAt": timestamp
}
```

### **Onboarding Completion:**
```json
{
  "onboardingCompleted": true,
  "isNewlyRegistered": false, // Mark as no longer newly registered
  "onboardingCompletedAt": timestamp // Optional: Track completion time
}
```

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### **For New Users:**
- ✅ **Signup** → Account created with `isNewlyRegistered: true`
- ✅ **PIN Verification** → Check if newly registered
- ✅ **Onboarding** → Show onboarding pages
- ✅ **Completion** → Mark as completed, go to landing page

### **For Existing Users:**
- ✅ **Login** → Check registration status
- ✅ **Direct Access** → Go straight to landing page
- ✅ **No Onboarding** → Skip onboarding entirely

### **For Returning New Users:**
- ✅ **Login** → Check if onboarding was completed
- ✅ **Skip Onboarding** → If already completed, go to landing page
- ✅ **Show Onboarding** → If not completed, show onboarding

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: New User Registration**
1. Create new account
2. Verify PIN
3. **Expected**: Onboarding appears
4. Complete onboarding
5. **Expected**: Goes to landing page
6. Logout and login again
7. **Expected**: Goes directly to landing page (no onboarding)

### **Scenario 2: Existing User Login**
1. Login with existing account
2. **Expected**: Goes directly to landing page
3. **Expected**: No onboarding appears

### **Scenario 3: Incomplete Onboarding**
1. Create new account
2. Verify PIN
3. **Expected**: Onboarding appears
4. Close app without completing onboarding
5. Login again
6. **Expected**: Onboarding appears again (until completed)

### **Scenario 4: Different User Roles**
1. **Admin**: Goes directly to admin dashboard (no onboarding)
2. **Supplier**: Goes directly to supplier dashboard (no onboarding)
3. **Buyer**: Follows onboarding flow if newly registered

## 🔍 **Database Verification**

### **Check New User:**
```javascript
// In Firestore Console
db.collection('users').doc('USER_ID').get()
```

**Expected for New User:**
```json
{
  "isNewlyRegistered": true,
  "onboardingCompleted": false,
  "verified": true
}
```

### **Check After Onboarding:**
```javascript
// In Firestore Console
db.collection('users').doc('USER_ID').get()
```

**Expected After Onboarding:**
```json
{
  "isNewlyRegistered": false,
  "onboardingCompleted": true,
  "verified": true
}
```

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Onboarding Still Shows for Existing Users**
**Solution:**
- Check if `isNewlyRegistered` is set to `false` for existing users
- Verify `onboardingCompleted` is set to `true`
- Check if user data is being read correctly from Firestore

### **Issue 2: New Users Don't See Onboarding**
**Solution:**
- Verify `isNewlyRegistered` is set to `true` during signup
- Check if `onboardingCompleted` is set to `false`
- Ensure PIN verification is working correctly

### **Issue 3: Onboarding Repeats for Same User**
**Solution:**
- Check if `onboardingCompleted` is being set to `true`
- Verify Firestore update is successful
- Check if `isNewlyRegistered` is being set to `false`

## 📈 **Performance Considerations**

### **Database Queries:**
- Only check onboarding status during login/verification
- Use efficient Firestore queries
- Cache onboarding status locally if needed

### **User Experience:**
- Fast login for existing users
- Smooth onboarding flow for new users
- No unnecessary delays or redirects

## 🎯 **Future Enhancements**

### **Potential Improvements:**
1. **Onboarding Analytics**: Track completion rates
2. **Custom Onboarding**: Different flows for different user types
3. **Onboarding Reset**: Allow users to reset onboarding
4. **Progressive Onboarding**: Show tips throughout the app
5. **Onboarding A/B Testing**: Test different onboarding flows

## 🔧 **Manual Override Commands**

### **Mark User as Newly Registered:**
```dart
await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('users')
    .doc('USER_ID')
    .update({
      'isNewlyRegistered': true,
      'onboardingCompleted': false,
    });
```

### **Mark User as Existing:**
```dart
await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('users')
    .doc('USER_ID')
    .update({
      'isNewlyRegistered': false,
      'onboardingCompleted': true,
    });
```

### **Reset Onboarding for Testing:**
```dart
await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('users')
    .doc('USER_ID')
    .update({
      'isNewlyRegistered': true,
      'onboardingCompleted': false,
    });
```

**The fix ensures that onboarding only appears for newly registered users, providing a better user experience for existing users while still introducing new users to the app features.**
